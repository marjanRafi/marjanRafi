# Marjan Rafi
### ☁️ DevOps & Platform Engineer
**Automating Reliability | Securing Cloud Infrastructure | scaling AI Operations**

I engineer **production-grade cloud platforms** that are secure by default and self-healing by design. Currently at **Pipeline Inc.** (Tokyo), I focus on the intersection of **Infrastructure as Code**, **Identity-Based Security**, and **Observability**.

### ⚡ Engineering Impact (Production)

> *Real-world systems I am currently building and operating.*

#### 🛡️ Zero-Trust Security Architecture
Designed and deployed an **RBAC-based SSH access system using Teleport**, replacing static keys for **24+ production nodes**.
* **Tech:** Teleport, SSO, IAM Roles, Linux Hardening.
* **Outcome:** Eliminated static credential management and enforced audit trails for all server access.

#### 🤖 AI Infrastructure & Data Ops
Orchestrating data pipelines and supporting **Vector DB + RAG integration** for internal AI tooling.
* **Tech:** Apache Airflow, Vector Databases, Python, AWS S3.
* **Outcome:** Optimized infrastructure for high-throughput LLM queries and automated data workflows.

#### 👁️ Observability & Reliability
Built a centralized monitoring stack to reduce "Mean Time to Detect" (MTTD).
* **Tech:** Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Loki.
* **Outcome:** Reduced incident detection latency by **~85%** through proactive alerting rules.

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
* **Immutable over Mutable:** Servers should be cattle, not pets. If it breaks, replace it; don't patch it.
* **Identity is the New Perimeter:** IP whitelisting isn't enough. I enforce access via **IAM Roles** and **Short-lived Certificates**.
* **Observability is Testing in Production:** If you can't see it, you can't fix it. Logs tell you *what* happened; metrics tell you *why*.
